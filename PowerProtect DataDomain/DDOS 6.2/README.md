# DELLEMC-DPS-ReST-api DataDomain 6.2  
This repository contains many ReST API collection for Postman https://www.getpostman.com/downloads/.
In this Postman collections I do work with an environment (postman_environment.json) where I define all variables needed to work with the ReST API like Server or login or auth token where needed and the api collection (postman_environment.json) where I do use this variables.
I also have added for the DELL Democenter Session a special environment you can import and use without any change.

Download the whole repository and play with all the collections and let me know what's working and what not.
If you download individual files make sure you really downloaded the json file and not a wrapped json file which will fail during import with a wrong format error.

With DDOS 61. you also do have a DD ReST test client you can reach @ https:/{{DD}}/api/doc/ for playing around.
