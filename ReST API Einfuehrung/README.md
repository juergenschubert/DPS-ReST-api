# DELLEMC-DPS-ReST-api getting started with postman

This is a short introduction in working with postman and NetWorker 19.1. The podcast video will show you howto. Link to this repository will be: http://bit.ly/2XHnyAo

This repository contains many ReST API collection for Postman https://www.getpostman.com/downloads/.
In this Postman collections I do work with an environment (postman_environment.json) where I define all variables needed to work with the ReST API like Server or login or auth token where needed and the api collection (postman_environment.json) where I do use this variables. So make sure you do import the environment plus the collection into Postman. I do recommend to import both files into Postman so you can work with. Do not forget to set the environment you have imported.
