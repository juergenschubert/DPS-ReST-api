# DELLEMC-DPS-Postman-Collections-RESTAPIs
Postman collections for Dell EMC Data Protection APIs.

Postman collections are a collection of pre-defined REST API calls for a particular product or API. In this case, this repository has Postman collections for Dell EMC Data Protection Systems.

These collections are a great start to demonstrate REST API functionality of Dell EMC DPS Products.
All you need is, install Postman and import the collections along with the environment variables. You can download Postman here https://www.getpostman.com/downloads/.
