# DELLEMC-DPS-Postman-Collections-RESTAPIs
####Postman collections for Dell EMC Data Protection APIs for PowerProtect DataManager.

Postman collections are a collection of pre-defined REST API calls for a particular product or API. In this case, this repository has Postman collections for Dell EMC Data Protection Systems.

These collections are a great start to demonstrate REST API functionality of Dell EMC DPS Products.
All you need is, install Postman and import the collections along with the environment variables. You can download Postman here https://www.getpostman.com/downloads/.  

Within this Postman collection you do find two different variables you should add and fill in values as not all are available.  
{{environment-variable}} - you should add this variable to your environment variable and give it a current value.  
Within the URI path you can find ":variable" which you do find in the PArms section under Path Variables. Give them values so the query will work.
