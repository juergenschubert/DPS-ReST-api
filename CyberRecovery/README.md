# DELLEMC-DPS-ReST-api Cyber Recovery  
This repository contains many ReST API collection for Postman https://www.getpostman.com/downloads/.
In this Postman collections I do work with an environment (postman_environment.json) where I define all variables needed to work with the ReST API like Server or login or auth token where needed and the api collection (postman_environment.json) where I do use this variables.
You will alos find a environment for the DELL Democenter Session.  So make sure you do import the environment plus the collection into Postman. I do recommend to import both files into Postman so you can work with. Do not forget to set the environment you have imported.

Download the whole repository and play with all the collections and let me know what's working and what not.
If you download individual files make sure you really downloaded the json file and not a wrapped json file which will fail during import with a wrong format error.
